# Hepatitis Reccomendation System

Built & designed a Recommendation System by building a chatbot on Telegram application based on a 'Hepatitis' model that we have deployed on Microsoft Azure. The aim of our recommendation system is to diagnose whether a person is having hepatitis or not based on the inputs that we provided to the chatbot using python on jupyter platform.
